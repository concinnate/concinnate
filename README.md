I have acquired extensive service and hospitality experience from my previous positions. I'm very comfortable around people, and my co-workers have often praised my ability to project an inclusive, friendly atmosphere. 

Initiative has paved many paths for me, and often led to additional responsibilities (therefore, experience) in most positions I have held. As someone that preaches the importance of perspective, I seek to do what makes sense rather than be limited by some narrow scope of "my job".

I can't prove it, but I'm fairly certain "Ask Tim" tends to trend in companies that hire me.
